const aboutMe1 = "I am a Junior Software Developer with about 2 years experience. I create Mobile Apps that are appealing and easy to use.\n" +

"in tackling these challanges, you'll find i'm worth working along side because I am task driven and eager to support companies building products that tackle crucial problems, create innovative businesses with modern solutions.";

"Given that producing most mordern apps require some sort of backend technology, I recently started exploring my options and i'm settling for using the MEAN stack "+
"(MongoDB, ExpressJS and NodeJS). I take interest in really getting to know a business, its goals and mission, " +
"and I think about how I can best apply myself to make your businness a success. I can be a great addition to your team."

const aboutMe3 = "I mostly use Flutter to produce responsive Mobile Apps that provides users the best and most appropriate experience suited for their respective devices. "+
"I build maintainable, easy to maintain mobile apps, I achieve this by breaking the apps into components. </p>In the large scale of things these components depend on each other but indirectly, the "+
"advantage, this makes for easy maintenance, reuseability and this eases testing which is really crucial. "+
"Another advantage would be, when new features are needed this can be added easily, this is crucial in growing businesses where features would be added based on the needs of the consumer. "+

"like Cloud Firestore, Firebase Authentication, Realtime Database, Analytics e.t.c. </p>I've always wanted to know how the above mentioned tools work and I believe the best way to achieve this would be to "+
"build them myself, starting from the basics. I've built basic authentication and database systems using the MEAN stack. </p>Being 'The new kid on the block' everything still looks very new to me, so I plan to utilize in  my future projects, third-party authentication services, adding ML capabilities" +
"and much more to broaden my knowledge in this area. "

const aboutMe5 = "Although being still very new in the grand scheme of things (Software development), I am very confident in the skills that I possess and certain that i'll push boundaries in whatever postion i'm in."
